# rascal_triangle

basic terminal pascal triangle generator as a rewrite in rust

this is a very pointless program for fun but it will generate out a pascal triangle out to a certain length

I wrote this for fun to rewrite a college project that was written in c and also to play around with rust traits

usage : 
  
  pascal nth_row_of_pascals_triangle
